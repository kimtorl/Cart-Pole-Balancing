CartPole Balancing

Watch the agent learn and master the art of balancing CartPole!

About the Project
Balancing a pole on a moving cart is a classic control problem that highlights the essence of reinforcement learning. In this project, we leverage the Q-learning algorithm to teach an AI agent how to balance CartPole effectively. Here's what makes this project intriguing:

Reinforcement Learning: Experience the fundamentals of RL in action as the agent learns from its interactions with the environment.

Dynamic Environment: The CartPole environment is dynamic and constantly changing, providing a challenging backdrop for the agent's learning journey.

Deep Q-Learning: Dive into the world of Q-learning, a foundational RL algorithm, and see how it can be used to solve complex tasks.

Visual Feedback: The project includes a visual demonstration, allowing you to witness the agent's progress in real-time.

Getting Started
To get started with CartPole Balancing with Q-Learning, follow these simple steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cartpole-q-learning.git
Install the necessary dependencies. You may want to use a virtual environment for isolation.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the Q-learning agent.

bash
Copy code
python cartpole_q_learning.py
Observe the agent's progress as it learns to balance the pole on the cart.

How it Works
The Q-learning algorithm works by updating a Q-table that associates state-action pairs with their expected rewards. The agent explores the environment, learns from its actions, and gradually improves its decision-making over time. Here's a simplified overview:

Initialization: Initialize the Q-table with arbitrary values.

Exploration: The agent explores the environment, selecting actions based on either random exploration or the learned Q-values.

Learning: Update the Q-values using the Bellman equation, which incorporates the immediate reward and the expected future rewards.

Policy Improvement: The agent's policy (action selection strategy) improves as it learns better Q-values.

Convergence: Continue exploration and learning until the Q-values converge to optimal values.

Testing: Evaluate the trained agent's performance on the CartPole task.

Results
Witness the evolution of the agent's performance over time. Compare its initial attempts with its later, more refined balancing skills. Explore the reward curves and the agent's ability to maintain equilibrium.
